This project involves working on a dataset provided by a Kaggle competition named "Space Titanic". The goal of the competition is to predict whether a passenger was transported to an alternate dimension during the spaceship's voyage. This project demonstrates the entire data science workflow: from data loading and cleaning to exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and finally, making predictions for submission.

## Dataset 📊
In this competition our task is to predict whether a passenger was transported to an alternate dimension during the Spaceship Titanic's collision with the spacetime anomaly. We were given a set of personal records recovered from the ship's damaged computer system.

### File and Data Field Descriptions
  #### train.csv 
  Personal records for about two-thirds (~8700) of the passengers, to be used as training data.
  
|Files     |Description     | 
|------------------|-------------------|
|Passenger Id      |A unique Id for each passenger.|
|HomePlanet        |Indicates whether the passenger elected to be put into suspended animation for the duration of the voyage. VGG 16| 
|Cabin             |The cabin number where the passenger is staying.|
|Destination       |The planet the passenger will be debarking to.| 
|Age               |The age of the passenger.| 
|VIP               |Whether the passenger has paid for special VIP service during the voyage.| 
|RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck           |Amount the passenger has billed at each of the Spaceship Titanic's many luxury amenities.| 
|Name              |The first and last names of the passenger.| 
|Transported       |Whether the passenger was transported to another dimension.| 

  #### test.csv
  Personal records for the remaining one-third (~4300) of the passengers, to be used as test data.
  
  #### sample_submission.csv
  A submission file in the correct format.    
|Files   |Description| 
|------------------|-------------------|
|Passenger Id       |Id for each passenger in the test set.| 
|Transported       |The target. For each passenger, predict either True or False.|
