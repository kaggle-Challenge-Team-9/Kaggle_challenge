Welcome to our GitHub repository for the Spaceship Titanic Kaggle Challenge! In this group assignment, our team has come together to develop a statistical/machine learning model to predict outcomes related to the Titanic dataset. This README file serves as a guide to understanding our project, workflow, and contributions.

## Dataset 📊
In this competition our task is to predict whether a passenger was transported to an alternate dimension during the Spaceship Titanic's collision with the spacetime anomaly. We were given a set of personal records recovered from the ship's damaged computer system.

### File and Data Field Descriptions
  #### train.csv 
  Personal records for about two-thirds (~8700) of the passengers, to be used as training data.
  
|Files     |Description     | 
|------------------|-------------------|
|Passenger Id      |A unique Id for each passenger.|
|HomePlanet        |Indicates whether the passenger elected to be put into suspended animation for the duration of the voyage. VGG 16| 
|Cabin             |The cabin number where the passenger is staying.|
|Destination       |The planet the passenger will be debarking to.| 
|Age               |The age of the passenger.| 
|VIP               |Whether the passenger has paid for special VIP service during the voyage.| 
|RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck           |Amount the passenger has billed at each of the Spaceship Titanic's many luxury amenities.| 
|Name              |The first and last names of the passenger.| 
|Transported       |Whether the passenger was transported to another dimension.| 

  #### test.csv
  Personal records for the remaining one-third (~4300) of the passengers, to be used as test data.
  
  #### sample_submission.csv
  A submission file in the correct format.    
|Files   |Description| 
|------------------|-------------------|
|Passenger d       |Id for each passenger in the test set.| 
|Transported       |The target. For each passenger, predict either True or False.| 
 
## Colab & GitHub 🖥
We have utilized Google Colab for collaborative coding and GitHub for version control and sharing our work. Our shared Colab notebook is linked to our GitHub repository, facilitating seamless collaboration. Detailed instructions for accessing our Colab notebook and GitHub repository can be found in the presentation slides provided.
